# **BERT (Base) Sequence Tagging on OpenKP** (Pytorch)

This repository provides the code of the model named **BERT (Base) Sequence Tagging** , which outperforms the Baselines (MSMARCO Team) on the [**OpenKP Leaderboard**](http://www.msmarco.org/leaders.aspx).

OpenKP (OpenKeyPhrase) is a large scale, open-domain keyphrase extraction dataset, which was first released in the paper [Open Domain Web Keyphrase Extraction Beyond Language Modeling](https://www.emnlp-ijcnlp2019.org/program/) at EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. Now it is a part of the [MSMARCO](http://www.msmarco.org/) dataset family .

## Quickstart

```
python 3.5
Pytorch 1.3.0
Tensorflow (tested on 1.14.0, only for tensorboardX)
```

You should first download the [**DATA**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aqPl8eUHKR1yTr4CX9lpzzmogp1mc3I3/view?usp=sharing) folder, which includes preprocess data, checkpoint and extracted keyphrase candidates for our result on the leardbord. Default directory structure should be setted as following : 

```
Bert2Tag
  |— DATA
    |— cached_features (saved preprocess data)
    |  |— openkp.train.json (OpenKP train dataset)
    |  |— openkp.valid.json (OpenKP Dev dataset)
    |  |— openkp.eval_public.json (OpenKP Valid dataset)
    |  |— Dev_reference.json (OpenKP Dev ground-truth keyphrases for test)
    |
    |— pretrain_model
    |  |— bert-base-cased
    |  |  |— vocab.txt
    |  |  |— config.json
    |  |  |— pytorch_model.bin
    |  |
    |  |— output (our best checkpoint)
    |     |— epoch_4.checkpoint
    |
    |— Pred (extracted keyphrase candidates)
       |— Dev_candidate.json
       |— EvalPublic_candidate.json (submitted to the leardbord)
```

P.S. `bert-base-cased` can also be download from [Huggingface's Pytorch-Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers)



#### * Re-produce evaluation result on Dev using our checkpoint

- **Get evaluation result using our generated keyphrase candidates** 

  ```
  python evaluate.py ./DATA/Pred/Dev_candidate.json ./DATA/cached_features/Dev_reference.json
  ```

  the`evaluate.py ` script is cloned from [official evaluation script](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenKP/blob/master/evaluate.py)  (we can only evaluate dev candidates because we don't know the ground-truths of Eval) , then the evaluation result on Dev can be shown as below :

  ```

  #########################
  ```

- **Generate keyphrase candidates using our checkpoint model**

  ```
  source test.sh
  ```
  
  The new generated keyphrases for Dev and Eval can be found in `./Pred`  folder .
  
  

#### * Re-train a new model from scratch

- **Train a new model using our preprocess data**

  ```
  source train.sh
  ```
  
  Several new files will be generated：
  
  - `logging.txt` and `viso` folder (if use tensorboardX) : track the train & valid losses saved in `./Log` ;
  
  - `epoch_i.checkpoint`  saved in `./output` after each i epoch.

    

#### * Re-preprocess source OpenKP datasets

- Download the OpenKP dataset from [MS MARCO](http://www.msmarco.org/dataset.aspx) website to your own directory

- Preprocess the dataset using our `preprocess.py` script (it might take 2~3 hours)

  ```
  python preprocess.py --source_dataset_dir "your own directory" --output_path "your save directory"
  ```
  
  

## Overview

#### * Data Characteristics

The documents of the dataset come from real world webs , with a diversified topic domain distribution differs from previous keyphrase extraction datasets (focuse on a single sciencific-field). 

For each document, 1-3 most relevant keyphrase labels have been generated by expert annotators, **they have to appear in the document**. 



#### * Model Architectures

Upon the Characteristics of the data, we formulated keyphrase extraction as a soft-select sequence tagging task, and first introduced BERT into open-domian keyprhase extraction (as we know). We describe our model's workflow as the following 3 stages :

- **Word-Level Representations :**   We encode an input document into a sequence of WordPiece tokens' vectors with a pretrained [BERT](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1423.pdf) (base), and then we pick up the first sub-token vector of each word to represent the input in word-level.

- **Phrase-Level Representations :** We perform a **soft-select** method to decode phrase from word-level vector instead of hard-select used in the standard sequence tagging task . 

  The word-level representation is feed into an classification layer to obtain the tag probabilities of each word on 5 classes  (O, B, I, E, U) , and then we employ different tag patterns for extracting different n-grams ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ) over the whole sequence. 

  Last there are a collect of n-gram candidates, each word of the n-gram just has one score.

  **Soft-select Example :** considering all 3-grams (B I E) on the L-length document, we can extract (L-3+1)  3-grams sequentially like sliding window. In each 3-gram, we only keep **B score** for the first word, **I score** for the middle word, and **E score** for the last word, etc.

  > **O** : Non Keyphrase ;  **B** : Begin word of the keyprase ;  **I** : Middle word of the keyphrase ;  **E** : End word of keyprhase ;  **U** : Uni-word keyphrase

- **Document-Level Keyphrase :** At the Last stage, the recovering from phrase-level n-grams to document-level keyphrases can be naturally formulated as a ranking task. 

  Incorporating with term frequency, we employ **Min Pooling** to get the final score of each n-gram (we tested Min / Mean / LogMean Pooling , Min pooling is the best) . Based on the final scores, we extract 5 top ranked keyprhase candidates for each document.
